# Roulette Web APP Project


### Goal: 

A Web App that allows users to choose black or red in the input and decide how much you want to bet. When you click submit, it will generate a random outcome on whether you won or not. Depending on whether or not you won, you will lose the money you bet or you will win 2x the amount you bet.
